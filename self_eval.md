# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I am most proud of being able to write the check_stock method, and the if statement code block inside, without any issues. I like thinking out the logic as I go, and seeing everything work out in the terminal.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods allow programmers to store blocks of code that do something. Instead of having to write out the code needed multiple times, the method can just be called on, with arguments passed in. Methods are similar to variables, storage containers that can be called on, to access what's inside, whenever needed.
